# Escape-From-Damnation


Escape from Damnation is a 3d top-down shooter developed for my High-Levels Game Development university module . The aim of the game is to escape from Damnation Castle. The prisoner will fight through various levels, enemies and traps to achieve freedom. Picking up various weapons and powerups, the player will grow stronger and stronger as they progress through the levels. However, Damnation Castle is known for its almost impossible to escape security. The further the prisoner goes to escape, the more torment and terror they will unveil.
